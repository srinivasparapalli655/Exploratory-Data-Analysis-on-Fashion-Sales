# 📊 Fashion Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Analysis on a real-world fashion sales dataset.  
The goal is to clean raw data, analyze sales and profit patterns, and extract actionable business insights using Python.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of raw sales data
- Clean and preprocess unstructured data
- Identify patterns in sales, discounts, and profit
- Detect outliers that affect business decisions
- Apply statistical techniques for better interpretation

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains fashion retail sales records with features such as:
- Units Sold
- Unit Price
- Discount Percentage
- Sales Amount
- Profit
- Order Date
- Customer Segment
- City
- Product Category

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Standardized column names
- Corrected city and category values
- Converted order date to datetime format
- Removed columns with excessive missing values
- Handled missing categorical values

## 📉 Outlier Detection
Outliers were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method for sales and pricing-related columns to avoid misleading insights.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed distribution of sales, prices, discounts, and profit
- Studied relationships between discount and profit
- Compared customer segments and product categories
- Identified top-selling and low-performing products

## 📐 Statistical Analysis
- Checked skewness and distribution of numerical features
- Applied log transformation to normalize sales amount
- Identified log-normal distribution in sales data

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Higher discounts significantly reduce profit margins
- Premium customer segments generate higher profit
- High product price does not always guarantee profit
- Proper data cleaning is critical for reliable insights
